Hey! My name is [Michael DeMarco](https://michaeldemar.co). And these are my projects.

- [ubc-webring](https://github.com/michaelfromorg/ubc-webring), a web ring for UBC computer science students 
- [more-slackthemes](https://github.com/michaelfromorg/more-slackthemes), a Slack theme browser and generator
- [vscode-puzzles](https://github.com/michaelfromorg/vscode-puzzles), a Visual Studio Code extension to help bring problems into your editor (e.g., from Project Euler, Advent of Code, and Reddit)
- [letterboxd-recommender](https://github.com/michaelfromorg/letterboxd-recommender) (WIP), an app to take your Letterboxd watch history and recommend you a new movie
- [bereal-wrapped2](https://github.com/michaelfromorg/bereal-wrapped2) (WIP), a client-only re-write of [bereal-wrapped](https://github.com/michaelfromorg/bereal-wrapped) (which was expensive to host, but cool)

I work at [Notion](https://notion.so/). I like building projects on top of it, too.

These ones are for importing data.

- [letterboxd2notion](https://github.com/michaelfromorg/letterboxd2notion), a script to sync data from Letterboxd to Notion

- [goodreads2notion](https://github.com/michaelfromorg/goodreads2notion) (WIP), a script to sync data from Goodreads to Notion
- [contacts2notion](https://github.com/michaelfromorg/contacts2notion) (WIP), a script to sync data from Google Contacts to Notion

And these are random.

- [jensen](https://github.com/michaelfromorg/jensen), a utility to triage e-mails and create Notion tasks
